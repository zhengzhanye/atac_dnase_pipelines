ATAC-Seq / DNase-Seq Pipeline
===================================================

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.156534.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.156534)

This pipeline is designed for automated end-to-end quality control and processing of ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data. The pipeline can be run on compute clusters with job submission engines or stand alone machines. It inherently makes uses of parallelized/distributed computing. Pipeline installation is also easy as most dependencies are automatically installed. The pipeline can be run end-to-end i.e. starting from raw FASTQ files all the way to peak calling and signal track generation; or can be started from intermediate stages as well (e.g. alignment files). The pipeline supports single-end or paired-end ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data (with or without replicates). The pipeline produces pretty HTML reports that include quality control measures specifically designed for ATAC-seq and DNase-seq data, analysis of reproducibility, stringent and relaxed thresholding of peaks, fold-enrichment and pvalue signal tracks.  The pipeline also supports detailed error reporting and easy resuming of runs. The pipeline has been tested on human, mouse and yeast ATAC-seq data and human and mouse DNase-seq data.

The ATAC-seq pipeline specification is also the official pipeline specification of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. The ATAC-seq pipeline protocol definition is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f0Cm4vRyDQDu0bMehHD7P7KOMxTOP-HiNoIvL1VcBt8/edit?usp=sharing). Some parts of the ATAC-seq pipeline were developed in collaboration with Jason Buenrostro, Alicia Schep and Will Greenleaf at Stanford.

The DNase-seq pipeline specification is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e3cCormg0SnQW6zr7VYBWvXC1GiPc5GSy80qlKBPwlA/edit?usp=sharing). Note that this is NOT the same as the official ENCODE DNase-seq pipeline.

## Java

Install Java 8 (jdk >= 1.8 or jre >= 1.8) on your system. If you don't have super-user privileges on your system, locally install it and add it to your `$PATH`.

* For Debian/Ubuntu (>14.10) based Linux:

     ```
     $ sudo apt-get install git openjdk-8-jre
     ```

* For Fedora/Red-Hat based Linux: 
 
     ```
     $ sudo yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk
     ```

* For Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty):

     ```
     $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java -y
     $ sudo apt-get update
     $ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
     ```

## Conda

Install Miniconda3 [latest](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh) on your system. **IMPORTANT** Make sure that the absolute path of the destination directory is short. Long path will cause an error in the depenecies installation step [issue #8](https://github.com/kundajelab/TF_chipseq_pipeline/issues/8).

```
$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Answer `yes` for the final question. If you choose `no`, you need to manually add Miniconda3 to your `$HOME/.bashrc`.

```
Do you wish the installer to prepend the Miniconda3 install location
to PATH in your /your/home/.bashrc ? [yes|no]
[no] >>> yes
```

Remove any other Anaconda from your `$PATH`. Check your loaded modules with `$ module list` and unload any Anaconda modules in your `$HOME/.bashrc`. Open a new terminal after installation.

## BigDataScript

Install BigDataScript v0.99999e ([forked](https://github.com/leepc12/BigDataScript)) on your system.
The original [BDS v0.99999e](https://github.com/pcingola/BigDataScript) does not work correctly with the pipeline
(see [PR #142](https://github.com/pcingola/BigDataScript/pull/142) and [issue #131](https://github.com/pcingola/BigDataScript/issues/131)).

```
$ wget https://github.com/leepc12/BigDataScript/blob/master/distro/bds_Linux.tgz?raw=true -O bds_Linux.tgz
$ mv bds_Linux.tgz $HOME && cd $HOME && tar zxvf bds_Linux.tgz
```

Add `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.bds` to your `$HOME/.bashrc`. If Java memory occurs, add `export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xms256M -Xmx728M -XX:ParallelGCThreads=1"` too.


## Pipeline

Get the latest version of the pipeline. **Don't forget to add `--recursive`**. ATAC-Seq pipeline uses modules from an external git repo (ataqc). ATAQC will not work correctly without `--recursive`.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kundajelab/atac_dnase_pipelines --recursive
```

## Dependencies

Install software dependencies automatically. It will create two conda environments (bds_atac and bds_atac_py3) under your conda.

```
$ bash install_dependencies.sh
```

If you don't use `install_dependencies.sh`, manually replace BDS's default `bds.config` with a correct one:

```
$ cp bds.config ./utils/bds_scr $HOME/.bds
```

If `install_dependencies.sh` fails, run `./uninstall_dependencies.sh`, fix problems and then try `bash install_dependencies.sh` again.

## Genome data

Install genome data for a specific genome `[GENOME]`. Currently `hg19`, `mm9`, `hg38` and `mm10` are available. Specify a directory `[DATA_DIR]` to download genome data. A species file generated on `[DATA_DIR]` will be automatically added to your `./default.env` so that the pipeline knows that you have installed genome data using `install_genome_data.sh`. If you want to install multiple genomes make sure that you use the same directory `[DATA_DIR]` for them. Each genome data will be installed on `[DATA_DIR]/[GENOME]`. If you use other BDS pipelines, it is recommended to use the same directory `[DATA_DIR]` to save disk space.

**IMPORTANT**: `install_genome_data.sh` can take longer than an hour for downloading data and building index. **DO NOT** run the script on a login node, use `qlogin` for SGE and `srun --pty bash` for SLURM.

```
# DO NOT run this on a login node
$ bash install_genome_data.sh [GENOME] [DATA_DIR]
```

If you have super-user privileges on your system, it is recommended to install genome data on `/your/data/bds_pipeline_genome_data` and share them with others.

```
$ sudo su
$ bash install_genome_data.sh [GENOME] /your/data/bds_pipeline_genome_data
```

You can find a species file `[SPECIES_FILE]` on `/your/data/bds_pipeline_genome_data` for each pipeline type. Then others can use the genome data by adding `-species_file [SPECIES_FILE_PATH]` to the pipeline command line. Or they need to add `species_file = [SPECIES_FILE_PATH]` to the section `[default]` in their `./default.env`.

# Installation for internet-free computers

The pipeline does not need internet connection but installers (`install_dependencies.sh` and `install_genome_data.sh`) do need it. So the workaround should be that first install dependencies and genome data on a computer that is connected to the internet and then move Conda and genome database directories to your internet-free one. Both computers should have **THE SAME LINUX VERSION**. 

* On your computer that has an internet access,
  * Follow [the installation instruction for general computers](#installation)
  * Move your Miniconda3 directory to `$HOME/miniconda3` on your internet-free computer.
  * Move your genome database directory, which has `bds_atac_species.conf` and directories per species, to `$HOME/genome_data` on your internet-free computer. `$HOME/genome_data` on your internet-free computer should have `bds_atac_species.conf`.
  * Move your BDS directory `$HOME/.bds` to `$HOME/.bds` on your internet-free computer.
  * Move your pipeline directory `atac_dnase_pipelines/` to `$HOME/atac_dnase_pipelines/` on your internet-free computer.

* On your internet-free computer,
  * Add your `miniconda3/bin` and BDS binary to `$PATH` in your bash initialization script (`$HOME/.bashrc` or `$HOME/.bash_profile`).

     ```
     export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/miniconda3/bin"
     export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.bds"
     ```

  * Modify `[default]` section in `$HOME/atac_dnase_pipelines/default.env`.

     ```
     [default]
     conda_bin_dir=$HOME/miniconda3/bin
     species_file=$HOME/genome_data/bds_atac_species.conf
     ```

* Modify all paths in `$HOME/genome_data/bds_atac_species.conf` so that they correctly point to the right files.
* Check BDS version.
     ```
     $ bds -version
     Bds 0.99999e (build 2016-08-26 06:34), by Pablo Cingolani
     ```
* Make sure that your java rumtime version is >= 1.8.
     ```
     $ java -version
     java version "1.8.0_111"
     Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14)
     Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)
     ```

# Usage

We recommend using BASH to run pipelines.

For general use, use the following command line: (for PE data set)
```
$ bds atac.bds -species [SPECIES; hg19, mm9, ... ] -nth [NUM_THREADS] -fastq1_1 [READ1] -fastq1_2 [READ2]
```

For DNase-seq: (it's <b>NOT `-dnase`</b>!)
```
-dnase_seq
```

The pipeline does not trim adapters by default. To automatically detect adapters,

```
-auto_detect_adapter
```

To specify adapter for each fastq, add `-adapter[REPLICATE_ID]_[PAIR_ID]:[POOL_ID]` for paired end dataset and `-adapter[REPLICATE_ID]:[POOL_ID]` for single ended one.
You can skip `:[POOL_ID]` if you have single fastq per replicate (SE) or single pair of fastqs per replicate (PE).

<b>IMPORTANT!</b> If your data set is <b>SINGLE ENDED</b> add the following to the command line, otherwise the pipeline works for PE by default.
```
-se 
```
You can also individually specify endedness for each replicate.
```
-se[REPLICATE_ID] 	# for exp. replicates, 
```
```
-se1 -pe2 -se3 ...
```
If you want to just align your data (no peak calling or further steps like IDR).
```
-align
```
If you don't want ATAQC, add the following to command line. 
```
-no_ataqc 
```
If you have just one replicate (PE), specify fastqs with `-fastq[REP_ID]_[PAIR_ID]`.
```
-fastq1_1 [READ_PAIR1] -fastq1_2 [READ_PAIR2] \
```
For multiple replicates (PE), specify fastqs with `-fastq[REP_ID]_[PAIR_ID]`. Add `-fastq[]_[]` for each replicate and pair to the command line:replicates.
```
-fastq1_1 [READ_REP1_PAIR1] -fastq1_2 [READ_REP1_PAIR2] -fastq2_1 [READ_REP2_PAIR1] -fastq2_2 [READ_REP2_PAIR2] ...
```
For multiple replicates (SE), specify fastqs with `-fastq[REP_ID]`:
```
-se -fastq1 [READ_REP1] -fastq2 [READ_REP2] ...
```
You can also specify an adapter to be trimmed for each fastq. Example: `-adapter1_1 [ADAPTER1_1] -adapter1_2 [ADAPTER1_2] ...` for PE or `-adapter1 [ADAPTER1] -adapter2 [ADAPTER2] ...`.

You can start from bam files. There are two kinds of bam files (raw or deduped) and you need to explicitly choose between raw bam (bam) and deduped one (filt_bam) with `-input [BAM_TYPE]`. Don't forget to add `-se` if they are not paired end (PE). For raw bams,
```
-bam1 [RAW_BAM_REP1] -bam2 [RWA_BAM_REP1] ...
```
For deduped (filtered) bams:
```
-filt_bam1 [FILT_BAM_REP1] -filt_bam2 [FILT_BAM_REP1] ...
```
For tagaligns (non-tn5-shifted):
```
-tag1 [TAGALIGN_REP1] -tag2 [TAGALIGN_REP2] ...
```
You can also mix up any data types.
```
-bam1 [RAW_BAM_REP1] -tag2 [TAGALIGN_REP2] ...
```
To subsample beds (tagaligns) add the following to the command line. This is different from subsampling for cross-corr. analysis. Peaks will be called with subsampled tagaligns.
```
-subsample [NO_READS_TO_SUBSAMPLE]
```
To change # of lines to subsample for cross-corr. analysis. This will not affect tasks downstream (peak calling and IDR).
```
-nreads [NO_READS_TO_SUBSAMPLE]
```
To disable pseudo replicate generation, add the following. By default, peak calling and IDR will be done for true replicates and pseudo replicates, but if you have `-true_rep` in the command line, you will also get IDR on true replicates only.
```
-true_rep
```
IDR analysis is optional in the pipeline by default. If there are more than two replicates, IDR will be done for every pair of replicates. to enable IDR add the following:
```
-enable_idr
```
For multimapping, (multimapping is disabled by default). Using this parameter implies `-mapq_thresh 30` (MapQ Thresh for the pipeline is fixed at 30).
```
-multimapping [MULTIMAPPING; use 4 for ENCODE samples]
```
To force a set of parameters (`-smooth_win 73 -idr_thresh 0.05 -multimapping 4`) for ENCODE3.
```
-ENCODE3
```

You can also define parameters in a configuration file. Key names in a configruation file are identical to parameter names on command line. 
```
$ bds atac.bds [CONF_FILE]

$ cat [CONF_FILE]
species = [SPECIES; hg19, mm9, ...]
nth   = [NUM_THREADS]
fastq1_1= [READ1]
fastq1_2= [READ2]
...
```

## List of all parameters

To list all parameters and default values for them,
```
$ bds atac.bds
```

## Stopping / Resuming pipeline

Press Ctrl + C on a terminal or send any kind of kill signals to it. Please note that this will delete all intermediate files and incomplete outputs for the running tasks. The pipeline automatically determines if each task has finished or not (by comparing timestamps of input/output files for each task). To run the pipeline from the point of failure, correct error first and then just run the pipeline with the same command that you started the pipeline with. There is no additional parameter for restarting the pipeline.

## Running pipelines with a cluster engine

On servers with a cluster engine (such as Sun Grid Engine and SLURM), **DO NOT QSUB/SBATCH BDS COMMAND LINE**. Run BDS command directly on login nodes. BDS is a task manager and it will automatically submit(qsub/sbatch) and manage its sub tasks.

**IMPORTANT!** Please read this section carefully if you run pipelines on Stanford SCG4 and Sherlock cluster.

Most clusters have a policy to limit number of threads and memory per user on a login node. One BDS process, as a Java-based task manager, takes up to 1GB of memory and 50 threads even though it just submits/monitors subtasks. So if you want to run more than 50 pipelines in parallel, your cluster will kill BDS processes due to resource limit on a login node (check resource limit per user with `ulimit -a`). For example of 50 pipelines, 50 GB of memory and 2500 threads will be taken by 50 BDS processes. So the Workaround for this is to make an interactive node to keep all BDS processes alive. Such interactive node must have long walltime enough to wait for all pipelines in it to finish. Recommended resource setting is 0.5GB memory per pipeline.

SGE example to make an interactive node for 100 pipelines: 1 cpu, 100GB memory, 3 days walltime.

```
$ qlogin -l h_rt=72:00:00 -l h_vmem=100G
```

SLURM example to make an interactive node for 100 pipelines: 1 cpus, 100GB memory, 3 days walltime.

```
$ srun -n 1 --mem 100G -t 3-0 -p [YOUR_PARTITON] --qos normal --pty /bin/bash -i -l 
```

Once you get an interactive node, repeat the following commands per sample to run a pipeline with using [`bds_scr`](#managing-multiple-pipelines).

```
$ cd [WORK_DIR]
$ bds_scr [SCREEN_NAME] [LOG_FILE_PATH] atac.bds -q [SGE_QUEUE_OR_SLURM_PARTITION] -nth [MAX_NUM_THREAD_PER_PIPELINE] ...
$ sleep 2 # wait for 2 seconds for safety
```

Then you can monitor your pipelines with `screen -ls` and `tail -f [LOG_FILE_PATH]`. If you want to run more than 200 pipelines, you would want to make multiple interactive nodes and distribute your samples to them.

## Parallelization

For completely serialized jobs, add `-no_par` to the command line. Individual tasks can still go multi-threaded.

**IMPORTANT!** You can set up a limit for total number of threads with `-nth [MAX_TOTAL_NO_THREADS]`. Total number of threads used by a pipeline will not exceed this limit.

Default `-nth` for each cluster is defined on `./default.env` (e.g. 16 on SCG and 8 on Kundaje lab cluster)

The pipeline automatically distributes `[MAX_TOTAL_NO_THREADS]` threads for jobs according to corresponding input file sizes. For example of two fastqs (1GB and 2GB) with `-nth 6`, 2 and 4 threads are allocated for aligning 1GB and 2GB fastqs, respectively. The same policy applies to other multi-threaded tasks like deduping and peak calling.

However, all multi-threaded tasks (like bwa, bowtie2, spp and macs2) still have their own max. memory (`-mem_APPNAME [MEM_APP]`) and walltime (`-wt_APPNAME [WALLTIME_APP]`) settings. Max. memory is **NOT PER CPU**. For example on Kundaje lab cluster (with SGE flag activated `bds -s sge bds_atac.bds ...`) or on SCG4, the actual shell command submitted by BDS for each task is like the following:

```
qsub -V -pe shm [NTH_ALLOCATED_FOR_APP] -h_vmem=[MEM_APP]/[NTH_ALLOCATED_FOR_APP] -h_rt=[WALLTIME_APP] -s_rt=[WALLTIME_APP] ...
```

This ensures that total memory reserved for a cluster job equals to `[MEM_APP]`. The same policy applies to SLURM.

## Specifying cluster queue

You can let BDS submit its subtasks to a specific queue `[QUEUE_NAME]` on Sun Grid Engine.
```
bds -q [QUEUE_NAME] -s sge atac.bds ...
bds -s sge atac.bds -q [QUEUE_NAME] ...
```

## Managing multiple pipelines

`./utils/bds_scr` is a BASH script to create a detached screen for a BDS script and redirect stdout/stderr to a log file `[LOG_FILE_NAME]`. If a log file already exists, stdout/stderr will be appended to it.

Monitor the pipeline with `tail -f [LOG_FILE_NAME]`. The only difference between `bds_scr` and `bds` is that you have `[SCR_NAME] [LOG_FILE_NAME]` between `bds` command and its parameters (or a BDS script name).

You can skip `[LOG_FILE_NAME]` then a log file `[SCR_NAME].log` will be generated on the working directory.

You can also add any BDS parameters (like `-dryRun`, `-d` and `-s`). The following example is for running a pipeline on Sun Grid Engine.

```
$ bds_scr [SCR_NAME] [LOG_FILE_NAME] atac.bds ...
$ bds_scr [SCR_NAME] atac.bds ...
$ bds_scr [SCR_NAME] -s sge atac.bds ...
```

Once the pipeline run is done, the screen will be automatically closed. To kill a pipeline manually while it's running, use `./utils/kill_scr` or `screen -X quit`:

```
$ screen -X -S [SCR_NAME] quit
$ kill_scr [SCR_NAME]
```

## Java issues (memory and temporary directory)

Picard tools is used for marking dupes in the reads and it's based on Java. If you see any Java heap space errors then increase memory limit for Java with `-mem_ataqc [MEM]` (default: `20G`) and `-mem_dedup [MEM]` (default: `12G`).

If your `/tmp` quickly fills up and you want to change temporary directory for all Java apps in the pipeline, then add the following line to your bash startup script (`$HOME/.bashrc`). Our pipeline takes in `$TMPDIR` (not `$TMP`) for all Java apps.

```
export TMPDIR=/your/temp/dir/
```

Another quick workaround for dealing with Java issues is not to use Picard tools in the pipeline. Add `-use_sambamba_markdup` to your command line and then you can use `sambamba markdup` instead of `picard markdup`.


## How to customize genome data installer?

Please refer to the section `Installer for genome data` on [BDS pipeline programming](https://kundajelab.github.io/bds_pipeline_modules/programming.html).


## Useful HTML reports

There are two kinds of HTML reports provided by the pipeline.

* BigDataScript HTML report for debugging: Located at the working folder with name atac_[TIMESTAMP]_report.html. This report is automatically generated by BigDataScript and is useful for debugging since it shows summary, timeline, Stdout and Stderr for each job.

* ATAC-Seq pipeline report for QC and result: The pipeline automatically generate a nice HTML report (Report.html) on its output directory (specified with -out_dir or just './out'). It summarizes files and directory structure, includes QC reports and show a workflow diagram and genome browser tracks for peaks and signals (bigwigs for pValue and fold change). Move your output directory to a web directory (for example, /var/www/somewhere) or make a softlink of it to a web directory. For genome browser tracks, specify your web directory root for your output  While keeping its structure. Make sure that you have bgzip and tabix installed on your system. Add the following to the command line:

      -url_base http://your/url/to/output -title [PREFIX_FOR_YOUR_REPORT]


# Output directory structure and file naming

For more details, refer to the file table section in an HTML report generated by the pipeline. Files marked as (E) are outputs to be uploaded during ENCODE accession.

# ENCODE accession guideline

For each pipeline rune, `ENCODE_summary.json` file is generated under the output directory (`-out_dir`) for ENCODE accession (uploading pipeline outputs to the ENCODE portal). This JSON file includes all metadata and QC metrics required for ENCODE accession.

For ENCODE3, Please make sure that you run pipelines with `-ENCODE3` flag.

Parameters required for ENCODE accesssion:
```
# required
        -ENCODE_accession <string>       : ENCODE experiment accession ID (or dataset).
        -ENCODE_award <string>           : ENCODE award (e.g. /awards/U41HG007000/).
        -ENCODE_lab <string>             : Lab (e.g. /labs/anshul-kundaje/)
        -ENCODE_assembly <string>        : hg19, GRCh38, mm9, mm10.
        -ENCODE_alias_prefix <string>    : Alias = Alias_prefix + filename
# optional
        -ENCODE_award_rfa <string>       : ENCODE award RFA (e.g. ENCODE3).
        -ENCODE_assay_category <string>  : ENCODE assay category.
        -ENCODE_assay_title <string>     : ENCODE assay title.
```

We also provide an [ENCODE fastq downloader](https://github.com/kundajelab/ENCODE_downloader). It downloads fastqs matching award_rfa, assay_category and assay_title, and then automatically generate a shell script to run multiple pipelines. Such shell script also includes these ENCODE accession parameter set.

## ENCODE accession spreadsheet (CSV) generation

`./utils/parse_summary_ENCODE_accession_recursively.py` recursively finds `ENCODE_summary.json` files and parse them to generate one big CSV spreadsheet for ENCODE accession.

```
$ python ./utils/parse_summary_ENCODE_accession_recursively.py -h

usage: ENCODE_summary.json parser for ENCODE accession [-h]
                                                       [--out-file OUT_FILE]
                                                       [--search-dir SEARCH_DIR]
                                                       [--json-file JSON_FILE]
                                                       [--sort-by-genome-and-exp]
                                                       [--ignored-accession-ids-file IGNORED_ACCESSION_IDS_FILE]

Recursively find ENCODE_summary.json, parse it and make a CSV for uploading to
the ENCODE portal. Use https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/pyencoded-
tools/blob/master/ENCODE_submit_files.py for uploading.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --out-file OUT_FILE   Output CSV filename)
  --search-dir SEARCH_DIR
                        Root directory to search for ENCODE_summary.json
  --json-file JSON_FILE
                        Specify json file name to be parsed
  --sort-by-genome-and-exp
                        Sort rows by genomes and ENCODE experiment accession
                        ID
  --ignored-accession-ids-file IGNORED_ACCESSION_IDS_FILE
                        Accession IDs in this text file will be ignored. (1
                        acc. ID per line)
```

## QC metrics spreadsheet (TSV) generation

`./utils/parse_summary_qc_recursively.py` recursively finds `ENCODE_summary.json` files and parse them to generate one big TSV spreadsheet for QC metrics.

```
$ python parse_summary_qc_recursively.py -h
usage: ENCODE_summary.json parser for QC [-h] [--out-file OUT_FILE]
                                         [--search-dir SEARCH_DIR]
                                         [--json-file JSON_FILE]

Recursively find ENCODE_summary.json, parse it and make a TSV spreadsheet of
QC metrics.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --out-file OUT_FILE   Output TSV filename)
  --search-dir SEARCH_DIR
                        Root directory to search for ENCODE_summary.json
  --json-file JSON_FILE
                        Specify json file name to be parsed
```

### samtools ncurses bug

Prepend a directory for `libncurses.so.5` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. See `install_dependencies.sh` for solution.
```
samtools: symbol lookup error: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncurses.so.5: undefined symbol: _nc_putchar
```

### Error: could not find environment: bds_atac

Unload any Anaconda Python modules. Remove locally installed Anaconda Python from your `$PATH`.

# Alternate Cloud-based Implementations

* The [Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project](https://www.encodeproject.org/pipelines/) is in the process of adopting this pipeline for uniform processing of ENCODE ATAC-seq data. The [official ENCODE implementation](https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC) by the ENCODE Data Coordination Center will be an exact mirror of our pipeline on [the DNAnexus cloud](https://www.dnanexus.com/) (i.e. results will be exactly reproducible). Note that using this service requires a user to pay for cloud compute time.

* [Epinomics](http://www.epinomics.co/) provides an independent, *free*, cloud-based pipeline implementation that adheres to the analysis protocol specifications of our pipeline. This implementation can be accessed at [https://open.epigenomics.co/#/encode](https://open.epigenomics.co/#/encode).

### Error: Java disk space error: Disk quota exceeded

This error happens when `${TMPDIR}` or `/tmp` is full so Java cannot write temporary files on it. You can specify Java temporary directory with the following paramter.
```
-java_tmp_dir [PATH]
```
